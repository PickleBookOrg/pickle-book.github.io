Initial subscriptions that start on the 26th, 27th, 28th, 29th, 30th, or 31st of a month will have the anniversary day assigned as the 25th for subsequent months, or other successive applicable periods as specified during your Subscription purchase process (each, a “Renewal Period”) unless You cancel the Subscription, or we terminate it. Any Renewal Period or the Initial Subscription Period are a “Subscription Period” and the Initial Subscription Period together with all Renewal Periods, if any, are the “Subscription Term.”
            c)
            You will be charged at the time You first purchase a Subscription and at the beginning of each Renewal Period, which is your assigned anniversary day (the “Subscription Billing Date”) for all applicable fees and taxes for the next Subscription Period.  
            d)
            If You activate a Subscription, then You authorize PICkle Book or its third-party payment processors to periodically charge, on a going-forward basis and until cancellation of the Subscription, all accrued sums on or after each Subscription Billing Date. For information on the “Subscription Fee”, please see our pricing page. PICkle Book or its third-party payment processor will bill the periodic Subscription Fee to the payment method associated with Your account or that You otherwise provide to us. You may cancel the Subscription by cancelling the Subscription in Your account on the app or contacting us at support@PICkle-Book.com. 
            4.3
            PICkle Book Credits
            a)
            Certain Subscriptions may include the option for you to create specified products (each, a “Subscription PICkle Book”) on a specified cadence during the applicable Subscription Term. During the term of Your Subscription, if You choose not to create a Subscription PICkle Book in the month (or other specified period) in which it became available to you as part of the applicable Subscription, Subscription Fees will continue to be due and payable for as long as your Subscription remains in effect. 
            b)
            PICkle Book Credits will expire 13 months from the applicable Subscription Billing Date. If You cancel Your Subscription, You will have 90 days from the cancellation date to use the PICkle Book Credits in Your account. After 90 days, Your previously purchased PICkle Book Credits and unused PICkle Book Credits will expire. If you choose to delete your Account, any outstanding Photo Book Credits in Your account at the time of deletion will expire immediately.

            c)
            PICkle Book Credits have no cash value or any other value outside of the Services and are not redeemable for cash. For the avoidance of doubt, PICkle Book Credits do not operate or serve as stored value facilities in any way. You may not transfer, trade, gift or otherwise exchange PICkle Book Credits. Note that PICkle Book Credits are separate from our gift cards. Unlike PICkle Book Credits, our gift cards never expire.
            4.5
            All Subscription Fees will be charged to the credit card associated with Your account or that You otherwise provide to us. If Your card is initially declined, we will retry payment on the card for 24 days. After 24 days, if Your credit card cannot be charged, PICkle Book will retry to submit the charge with another credit card that You have on file. If You do not have another credit card on file with PICkle Book, PICkle Book reserves the right to terminate your access to the Site and any current Subscription and delete Your account and any information or User Content (defined below) associated with Your account without any liability to You. In addition to outstanding Subscription Fees, a delinquent account will be charged with fees or charges that are incidental to any chargeback or collection of any unpaid amount, including collection fees.
            4.6
            The Subscription Fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities, and You shall be responsible for payment of all such taxes, levies, or duties. 
            4.7
            PICkle Book reserves the right to determine pricing for the Product. PICkle Book will make reasonable efforts to keep pricing information published on the Services up to date. We encourage You to check our pricing page periodically for current pricing information. PICkle Book may increase the Subscription Fees from time to time, in its sole discretion, including additional fees or charges, if PICkle Book gives You advance notice of changes before they apply. PICkle Book, at its sole discretion, may make promotional offers with different features and different pricing to any of PICkle Book’s customers. These promotional offers, unless made to You, will not apply to Your offer or this Agreement. In addition, PICkle Book reserves the right to charge for use of Services that are currently available free of charge. You will not be charged for using any Services unless You have opted in to pay for such Services.

            5. Termination

            5.1
            This Agreement will remain in effect until: (a) PICkle Book terminates Your rights under this Agreement, which it may do immediately, without notice or liability, if You fail to comply with any term(s) of this Agreement; or (b) You cancel Your access to the Services, whichever occurs first. You may terminate Your access to the Site within the account settings or by submitting a request to PICkle Book’ customer support department. You may terminate Your access to PICkle Book by submitting a request to PICkle Book by email: Support@Pickle-Book.com

            5.2
            You acknowledge that if You breach this Agreement, PICkle Book may have no adequate remedy at law, will suffer irreparable harm as a result of such a breach, and therefore will be entitled to injunctive relief without the obligation of posting a bond. Upon termination of this Agreement: (a) You agree to immediately cease using the Services; (b) Your access to the Services will be automatically terminated and Registration Data will be removed; (c) PICkle Book may immediately delete or destroy all User Content and Your Data, subject to requirements of Law; (d) You must pay PICkle Book any unpaid Subscription Fees and other amounts incurred prior to the effective date of termination; and (e) Sections 2, 5.2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 will survive.

            6. Intellectual Property

No title to or ownership of the Services, including, without limitation, any logos, designs, texts, graphics, pictures, data or content, software, platform, technologies or any proprietary rights related to the Services, is transferred under or by virtue of this Agreement. PICkle Book reserves all rights in and to the Services not expressly granted to You under this Agreement.

            Certain features of the Services may permit users to submit, upload, publish, broadcast, or otherwise transmit (“Post”) content to the Services, including messages, reviews, photos, video or audio (including sound or voice recordings and musical recordings embodied in the video or audio), images, folders, data, text, and any other works of authorship or other works (“User Content”). 
            7.3

            b)
            Your User Content, and the Posting or other use of Your User Content as contemplated by this Agreement, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, dilute, misappropriate, or otherwise breach any third-party right, including any privacy right, right of publicity, or any other Intellectual Property Right, contract, or proprietary right; (ii) slander, defame, libel, or invade the right of privacy, publicity or other property rights of any other person; or (iii) cause PICkle Book to violate any Law or require us to obtain any further licenses from or pay any royalties, fees, compensation or other amounts or provide any attribution to any third parties; and
            c)
            Your User Content could not be deemed by a reasonable person to be objectionable, profane, indecent, pornographic, harassing, threatening, embarrassing, hateful, or otherwise inappropriate.
            7.5
            PICkle Book is under no obligation to edit or control User Content that You or other users Post and will not be in any way responsible or liable for User Content. PICkle Book may, however, at any time and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User Content that in our sole judgment violates this Agreement, is alleged to violate the rights of third parties, or is otherwise objectionable. You understand that, when using the Services, You will be exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent, or objectionable. You agree to waive, and do waive, any legal or equitable right or remedy You have or may have against PICkle Book with respect to User Content. If notified by a user or content owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to this Agreement, we may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do at any time and without notice. For clarity, PICkle Book does not permit infringing activities on the Services.
            7.6
            PICkle Book does not control and does not have any obligation to monitor: (a) User Content; (b) any content made available by third parties; or (c) the use of the Services by its users. You acknowledge and agree that PICkle Book reserves the right to, and may from time to time, monitor any and all information transmitted or received through the Services for operational and other purposes.

During monitoring, information may be examined, recorded, copied, and used in accordance with our Privacy Policy. PICkle Book may block, filter, mute, remove or disable access to any User Content uploaded to or transmitted through the Services without any liability to the user who Posted such User Content to the Services or to any other users of the Services.

            8.3
            Procedure for Reporting Claimed Infringement. If You believe that any content made available on or through the Services has been used or exploited in a manner that infringes an Intellectual Property Right You own or control, then please promptly send a written “Notification of Claimed Infringement” to the Designated Agent identified above containing the following information:
            a)

            b)
            a description of the copyrighted work or other Intellectual Property Right that You claim has been infringed;
            c)

            Your address, telephone number, and email address;
            e)
            a statement by You that You have a good faith belief that the use of the materials on the Services of which You are complaining is not authorized by the copyright or other Intellectual Property Right owner, its agent, or the Law; and
            f)
            a statement by You that the above information in Your notice is accurate and that, under penalty of perjury, You are the copyright or other Intellectual Property Right owner or authorized to act on the Intellectual Property Right owner’s behalf.
            Your Notification of Claimed Infringement may be shared by PICkle Book with the user alleged to have infringed a right You own or control as well as with the operators of publicly available databases that track notifications of claimed infringement, and You consent to PICkle Book making such disclosures. You should consult with Your own lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm Your obligations to provide a valid notice of claimed infringement.
            8.4
            Repeat Infringers. PICkle Book’ policy is to: (a) remove or disable access to material that PICkle Book believes in good faith, upon notice from an Intellectual Property Rights owner or authorized agent, is infringing the Intellectual Property Rights of a third party by being made available through the Services; and (b) in appropriate circumstances, to terminate the accounts of and block access to the Services by any user who repeatedly or egregiously infringes other people’s copyright or other Intellectual Property Rights. PICkle Book will terminate the accounts of users that are determined by PICkle Book to be repeat infringers. PICkle Book reserves the right, however, to suspend or terminate accounts of users in our sole discretion. 
            8.5
            Counter Notification. If You receive a notification from PICkle Book that material made available by You on or through the Services has been the subject of a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then You will have the right to provide PICkle Book with what is called a “Counter Notification.” To be effective, a Counter Notification must be in writing, provided to PICkle Book’ Designated Agent through one of the methods identified in Section 8.2, and include substantially the following information:
            a)
            Your physical or electronic signature;
            b)
            identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled;
            c)
            a statement under penalty of perjury that You have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or misidentification of the material to be removed or disabled; and
            d)
            Your name, address, and telephone number, and a statement that You consent to the jurisdiction of Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is located, or if You are residing outside of the United States, then for any judicial district in which PICkle Book may be found, and that You will accept service of process from the person who provided notification under Section 8.2 above or an agent of that person.
            A party submitting a Counter Notification should consult a lawyer or see 17 U.S.C. § 512 to confirm the party’s obligations to provide a valid counter notification under the Copyright Act.
            8.6
            Reposting of Content Subject to a Counter Notification. If You submit a Counter Notification to PICkle Book in response to a Notification of Claimed Infringement, then PICkle Book will promptly provide the person who provided the Notification of Claimed Infringement with a copy of Your Counter Notification and inform that person that PICkle Book will replace the removed User Content or cease disabling access to it in 10 business days, and PICkle Book will replace the removed User Content and cease disabling access to it not less than 10, nor more than 14, business days following receipt of the Counter Notification, unless PICkle Book’ Designated Agent receives notice from the party that submitted the Notification of Claimed Infringement that such person has filed an action seeking a court order to restrain the user from engaging in infringing activity relating to the material on PICkle Book’ system or network.
            8.7
            False Notifications of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notifications. The Copyright Act provides at 17 U.S.C. § 512(f) that: “[a]ny person who knowingly materially misrepresents under [Section 512 of the Copyright Act (17 U.S.C. § 512)] (1) that material or activity is infringing, or (2) that material or activity was removed or disabled by mistake or misidentification, will be liable for any damages, including costs and attorneys’ fees, incurred by the alleged infringer, by any copyright owner or copyright owner’s authorized licensee, or by a service provider, who is injured by such misrepresentation, as the result of PICkle Book relying upon such misrepresentation in removing or disabling access to the material or activity claimed to be infringing, or in replacing the removed material or ceasing to disable access to it.” PICkle Book reserves the right to seek damages from any party that submits a Notification of Claimed Infringement or Counter Notification in violation of the Law.
            9. Disclaimer of Warranties
            9.1 YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE SERVICES IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.

            10. Limitation of Liability
            10.1 TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, PICKLE BOOK WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND REGARDLESS OF LEGAL THEORY, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR COMPUTER MALFUNCTION, LOST PROFITS, LOSS OR CORRUPTION OF YOUR DATA OR USER CONTENT, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, AND/OR THE COST TO OBTAIN SUBSTITUTE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT OR THE USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE) THE SERVICES, HOWEVER CAUSED AND WHETHER ARISING UNDER A THEORY OF CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY, EVEN IF PICKLE BOOK WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT SHALL PICKLE BOOK’ TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES EXCEED THE GREATER OF THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID TO PICKLE BOOK FOR THE SERVICES DURING THE LAST MONTH PRECEDING THE DATE THE CLAIM AROSE, OR PRORATED IF PAID ANNUALLY, OR U.S. $100.00. THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, AND EVEN IF A PARTY WAS ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. BECAUSE SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF DAMAGES, THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN SUCH STATES, THE LIABILITY OF PICKLE BOOK AND ITS REPRESENTATIVES IS LIMITED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY SUCH STATE LAW. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY EVEN IF YOUR REMEDIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT FAIL OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.
            10.2 ANY CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM YOU MAY HAVE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE SERVICES, THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY ORDER MUST BE COMMENCED WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES; OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION OR CLAIM IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.

            12. Export Control Laws
            The Services are subject to export controls under the laws and regulations of the United States (“U.S.”) and any other applicable countries’ laws and regulations. You agree to comply with such laws and regulations governing export, re-export, transfer and use of the Services, and You shall obtain all required U.S. and local authorizations, permits, or licenses. You represent and warrant that: (a) You are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (b) You are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
            Dispute Resolution and Arbitration
            13.1
            Except as described in Section 13.2 and 13.3, You and PICkle Book agree that every dispute arising in connection with this Agreement, the Services, or communications from us will be resolved through binding arbitration. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, is less formal than a court proceeding, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation, or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this Agreement. Any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement will be resolved by the arbitrator.
            YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS AGREEMENT, YOU AND PICKLE BOOK ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.
            13.2
            Although we are agreeing to arbitrate most disputes between us, nothing in this Agreement will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (a) bring an individual action in small claims court; (b) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state, or local agency if that action is available; (c) seek injunctive relief in a court of law in aid of arbitration; or (d) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.
            13.3
            If You do not wish to resolve disputes by binding arbitration, You may opt out of the provisions of this Section 13 within 30 days after the date that You agree to this Agreement by sending a letter to PICkle Book, LLC, Attention: Legal Department – Arbitration Opt-Out, 800 N King ST, Suite 304, Wilmington, DE 19018 that specifies: Your full legal name, the email address associated with Your account on the Services, and a statement that You wish to opt out of arbitration (“Opt-Out Notice”). Once PICkle Book receives Your Opt-Out Notice, this Section 13 will be void and any action arising out of this Agreement will be resolved as set forth in Section 14. The remaining provisions of this Agreement will not be affected by Your Opt-Out Notice.
            13.4
            This arbitration agreement, and any arbitration between us, is subject the Federal Arbitration Act and will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (collectively, “AAA Rules”) as modified by this Agreement. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at +1-800-778-7879, or by contacting PICkle Book.
            13.5
            Before initiating arbitration, a party must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by certified U.S. Mail or by Federal Express (signature required) or, only if that other party has not provided a current physical address, then by electronic mail (“Notice of Arbitration”). PICkle Book’ address for Notice of Arbitration is: PICkle Book LLC, 800 N King ST, Suite 304, Wilmington, DE 19801. The Notice of Arbitration must: (a) identify the name or account number of the party making the claim; (b) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (c) set forth the specific relief sought (“Demand”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice of Arbitration is received, You or PICkle Book may commence an arbitration proceeding. If You commence arbitration in accordance with this Agreement, PICkle Book will reimburse You for Your payment of the filing fee, unless Your claim is for more than US$10,000 or if PICkle Book has received 25 or more similar demands for arbitration, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of the claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules and the other party may seek reimbursement for any fees paid to AAA.
            13.6
            Any arbitration hearing will take place in the county and state of Your residence unless we agree otherwise or, if the claim is for US$10,000 or less (and does not seek injunctive relief), You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (a) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (b) through a telephonic or video hearing; or (c) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of Your residence. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by You or PICkle Book must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. 
            13.7
            Except as provided in Section 13.8, the arbitrator can award any relief that would be available if the claims had been brough in a court of competent jurisdiction. If the arbitrator awards You an amount higher than the last written settlement amount offered by PICkle Book before an arbitrator was selected, PICkle Book will pay to You the higher of: (a) the amount awarded by the arbitrator and (b) US$10,000. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding on all parties, except (1) for judicial review expressly permitted by law or (2) if the arbitrator’s award includes an award of injunctive relief against a party, in which case that party shall have the right to seek judicial review of the injunctive relief in a court of competent jurisdiction that shall not be bound by the arbitrator’s application or conclusions of law. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
            13.8
            YOU AND PICKLE BOOK AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. FURTHER, UNLESS BOTH YOU AND PICKLE BOOK AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A REPRESENTATIVE OR CLASS PROCEEDING. 
            13.9
            If PICkle Book makes any substantive change to this arbitration provision, You may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to PICkle Book’ address for Notice of Arbitration, in which case Your account with PICkle Book will be immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes You rejected will survive.
            13.10
            If Section 13.8 or the entirety of this Section 13 is found to be unenforceable, or if PICkle Book receives an Opt-Out Notice from You, then the entirety of this Section 13 will be null and void and, in that case, the exclusive jurisdiction and venue described in Section 14 will govern any action arising out of or related to this Agreement.
            14. Governing Law; Venue
            This Agreement and any dispute or claim arising out of or related to this Agreement, its subject matter, or its formation (in each case, including non-contractual disputes or claims) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to this Agreement, the Site or the Services shall be instituted exclusively in the federal or state courts located in Delaware, and You further agree that such courts shall have in persona jurisdiction and venue with respect to You, and You hereby submit to the jurisdiction and venue of such courts and waive any objection.
            15. Complete Agreement
            This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between You and PICkle Book with respect to Your use of the Site and the Services and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous understandings, whether written or oral, regarding such subject matter. PICkle Book reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify this Agreement at any time upon notice to You, including by posting a revised version of this Agreement on the Site. Any such modified Agreement will be effective immediately upon being made available to You, and your continued use of the Services thereafter constitutes Your affirmative acceptance of such modified Agreement. Otherwise, the terms of this Agreement may not be modified, in whole or in part, except by written agreement executed by an authorized signatory of PICkle Book. If You are dissatisfied with the terms of the Agreement or any modifications thereof, then You agree that Your sole and exclusive remedy is to discontinue any use of the Services.
            16. Miscellaneous
            16.1
            Any remedy of PICkle Book set forth in this Agreement is in addition to any other remedy afforded to PICkle Book under applicable Law or otherwise. PICkle Book’ failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, then that provision is to be construed either by modifying it to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable (if permitted by Law) or by disregarding it (if not). If an unenforceable provision is modified or disregarded in accordance with this Section, the rest of the Agreement is to remain in effect as written, and the unenforceable provision is to remain as written in any circumstances other than those in which the provision is held to be unenforceable. You may not assign or otherwise transfer any of Your rights or obligations under this Agreement without PICkle Book’ prior written consent. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section 16.1 shall be void. PICkle Book may freely assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations under this Agreement. The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall apply to, and be binding upon, the approved successors and permitted assigns of the parties hereto. This Agreement does not create a partnership, franchise, joint venture, agency, fiduciary or employment relationship between the parties. This Agreement does not and is not intended to confer any rights or remedies upon any person other than You and PICkle Book. For all purposes of this Agreement, the words “including” and “includes” mean inclusion without limitation.
